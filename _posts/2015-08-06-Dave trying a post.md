## Introduction
Writing case studies is one of the ways that we share what we've learned and
leverage our work.  Publshing case studies enables us to take the work that we
 do with one partner and share it with millions, extending our reach and impact.

 PCT Case studies describe an interesting customer problem that we have solved
 with code.  Most case studies are 3-5 pages long, include code snippets, and
 reference blog posts and other case studies for deeper dives into specific
 topics.
