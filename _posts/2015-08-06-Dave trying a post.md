## Introduction

Today, I’m at Microsoft’s Worldwide Partner Conference in Orlando, Florida. When it comes to talking to our partners, what is top of mind for me is ensuring Microsoft empowers our partners’ success and profitability through innovation on our platform.  Today’s sessions focused upon a number of things that partners should be thinking about to continue driving success.  For my part of today’s conversation, I focused upon disruption and the transformative opportunities self-disruption can provide.

In a world where technological and business model changes are accelerating, finding an opportunity to disrupt – a competitor, an industry or even your own company – is more achievable than at any point in history.  Over the last decade, change has come to every facet of life, from the way we exercise with wearables, to the ways we teach in schools with devices.  Change is ubiquitous.  Given the rate of change in technology, disruption is no longer an “if”, but a “when”.  So if disruption is unavoidable, businesses have two choices: be in the business of disruption – or be disrupted.


Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s CEO, nailed it: We believe that every industrial company will become a software company. This means that every industry has already been disrupted by the necessity of all companies becoming ISVs.  Why?  Because a new wave of digital upstarts have already embraced the latest capabilities of technology to drive change, across every industry. From Uber in transportation to AirBnb in Travel, every industry is seeing new players seeking to capture revenue and share.

At Microsoft, we are driven by opportunities for disruption.  We’ve seen multiple waves of disruption come and go - and through these waves we’ve disrupted, often in conjunction with partners like you. We’ve continued to evolve, for example, disrupting our Office business from a collection of boxed products, and then to a business that leveraged a client and server model with Exchange and SharePoint.
