## Introduction
Writing case studies is one of the ways that we share what we've learned and
leverage our work.  Publshing case studies enables us to take the work that we
 do with one partner and share it with millions, extending our reach and impact.

 PCT Case studies describe an interesting customer problem that we have solved
 with code.  Most case studies are 3-5 pages long, include code snippets, and
 reference blog posts and other case studies for deeper dives into specific
 topics.

Jeffrey Immelt, GE’s CEO, nailed it: We believe that every industrial company will become a software company. This means that every industry has already been disrupted by the necessity of all companies becoming ISVs.  Why?  Because a new wave of digital upstarts have already embraced the latest capabilities of technology to drive change, across every industry. From Uber in transportation to AirBnb in Travel, every industry is seeing new players seeking to capture revenue and share.

At Microsoft, we are driven by opportunities for disruption.  We’ve seen multiple waves of disruption come and go - and through these waves we’ve disrupted, often in conjunction with partners like you. We’ve continued to evolve, for example, disrupting our Office business from a collection of boxed products, and then to a business that leveraged a client and server model with Exchange and SharePoint.
